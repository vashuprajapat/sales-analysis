# Sales Analysis for Supermarket Data
This repository contains a sales analysis of supermarket data from January 2019 to March 2019. The analysis is performed using the Python library **`pandas`** and **`matplotlib`** (**`plt`**).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.0 or more
- pandas
- matplotlib

To install the required packages, run the following command:
```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib
```


### Data

The data used for this analysis is a CSV file containing information about sales from a supermarket. The file includes the following columns:
- Date
- Total
- Product
- Quantity
- gross income
- Tax 5%

The data can be found in the `root` folder, named `supermarket_sales - Sheet1.csv`

### Jupyter Notebook

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter notebook named `salesAnalysis.ipynb`. To run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter installed. You can install it by running:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```
Once Jupyter is installed, navigate to the repository directory in the command line and run the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will open the Jupyter notebook interface in your web browser. From there, you can open the `salesAnalysis.ipynb` notebook and run the code.

## Analysis

The analysis in the notebook includes the following tasks:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Identifying trends and patterns in the data

## Conclusion

The notebook contains the detailed process of cleaning, preprocessing, analyzing and visualizing the data. The data is then used to identify trends and patterns in the sales data. This can be used by the supermarket to make informed decisions regarding their inventory, pricing and marketing strategies.
